# XML-Parser

Parsing an XML file involves analyzing the structure and content of an XML document and turning 
it into a more easily understandable format, such as a tree or a list of objects. This process is useful 
for extracting specific data from an XML file, as well as for manipulating and modifying the 
contents of the file. There are several tools and libraries available for parsing XML files, including 
DOM (Document Object Model) parsers, SAX (Simple API for XML) parsers, and XML Pull 
parsers. Each of these approaches has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice will 
depend on the specific requirements of the task at hand. Regardless of the approach taken, proper 
handling of errors and edge cases is important to ensure that the XML file is parsed accurately and 
efficiently.
